<h1>Check out what your neighbors are saying about us...</h1>
	<p>I took my senior cat here when it was time to say goodbye.  Stating that I was a wreck over this is an understatement.  I was greeted with compassion and sympathy by the whole staff when I arrived.  Dr.Cooper was understanding and patient and let me spend as much time as I needed to say my goodbyes.  Scott the vet technician was absolutely wonderful in that he explained what was going to happen and stayed with me and offered strength and thoughfulness for what I was going through.  I can't say enough about how compassionate everyone was to me about having to put my cat down.  Scott was considerate enough to think of me paying the bill before hand so I wouldn't have to deal with it afterwards, (I wouldn't have thought of that).  The cost of it plus creamation was very reasonable if not quite less than I expected.  I would recommend this animal hospital to anyone and everyone and will be taking my remaining senior cat there for his medical needs from now on.<br/>~Tracey W.<br/>Charlotte, NC</p>
	<p>We have only been going to St. Francis Hospital for Animals for about 10 months but in that time Dr. Cooper and his staff have always provided us with excellent service.<br/>From the initial check up for our newly adopted dog to our recent drama of a chewed advil bottle, both Dr. Cooper and his staff were always friendly and knowledgeable and you could really tell they cared about us and our pet.<br/>I found them after getting a recommendation from a co-worker and would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone who asked.<br/>~Andrew O.<br/>Charlotte, NC</p>
	<p>I've been going to St Francis (specifically, Dr. Cooper) for several years now.  Getting there is a little bit of a drive, but I continue to prefer them over closer options.  Why? They're always kind, helpful, and understanding.  When I recently had to bring the dog in for a sick visit, everyone, from the lady at the front desk to the vet assistant, babied him and showed compassion for his distress.<br/>Dr. Cooper in particular is an excellent vet.  He obviously loves the animals, but he's also very no-nonsense.  He's careful to avoid pushing unnecessary, expensive treatments.  Now, don't get me wrong: I love my dog and would pay for the expensive option if it was the best action, but more often than not, it's just excessive.  This is the same approach that I take to my own healthcare.  <br/>My only caution has to do with location.  Their building is behind another, so you can't see it from the road.  Watch for the sign marking the entrance, or you will zoom right past.<br/>So, if you want compassionate, thorough care for your fuzzy family members, but don't want to be barraged by endless suggestions for $600 diagnostic tests here, $400 unnecessary medicines there, you should check out Dr. Cooper and St. Francis Hospital.<br/>~Adam R.<br/>Charlotte, NC</p>

	<h2>Site Intent:</h2>
	
		<p>The client's goal is to inform the end-user of the many services and benefits offered by St. Francis Hospital for Animals.  The site serves the purpose of providing information, but it completely misses the mark on visual appeal.  The site seems very plain and not at all responsive.  Viewing this site on a mobile device would be terrible.</p>

		<p>The goal of the end-user visiting this site would be to find a veterinarian for his furry family member.  Because pets are such important members of one's family, the end-user would not want to trust just anyone.  He would want to know that the chosen vet was qualified and could meet all the needs of his family pet.  As stated before, the goal of receiving information is being met, but the site is not interesting enough to keep the user's attention.  As a user, I would not click past the first page or two.  The site is not visually appealing, and the color choices are too contrasting.</p>

		<p>The goal of the newly, redesigned site will be to make the site more attractive to users.  Through better use of color, placement, and photographs, the site will be more pleasing to the eyes.  By redesigning forms and navigation, the site will become more user friendly.</p>

	<h2>Competitive Analysis:</h2>
		
		<p><a href="http://www.dilworthanimalhospital.com/">Dilworth Animal Hospital</a> is also located in Charlotte, NC and appears to be a direct competitor. This company's site has a better color scheme, but it lacks a strong navigation bar.  Some of the site's pages are well designed, but several of them could use some work.  Dilworth Animal Hospital received a 5-star rating from <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/dilworth-animal-hospital-charlotte">Yelp.com</a> and a 5-star rating from <a href="http://www.mojopages.com/biz/dilworth-animal-hospital/charlotte/nc/28203/37998263?sl=30570503&so=0">Mojopages.com</a>.  According to mojopages, some of their keywords are "surgical procedures", "vaccinations", and "exotics".</p> 

		<p><a href="http://www.commonwealthanimalhospital.net/">Commonwealth Animal Hospital</a> is another competitor.  Their site doesn't have much color, but the site is very well designed.  The navigation is easy to use, pictures are well placed, and the home page gives just enough information to leave the user wanting more.  They received a 4.5-star rating from <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/commonwealth-animal-hospital-charlotte">Yelp.com</a> and a 4-star rating from <a href="http://www.mojopages.com/biz/commonwealth-animal-hospital/charlotte/nc/28205/6098136?sl=30570757&so=0">Mojopages.com</a>.  According to mojopages, some of their keywords are "pet grooming", "animal hospitals", "boarding", and "vaccinations".</p>

		<p><a href="http://southparkvet.net/">SouthPark Animal Hospital</a>'s website is extremely similar to that of Commonwealth Animal Hospital.  It appears that the sites were designed by the same person.  Even the navigation, layout, and one of the main photos are the same.  The colors in the heading and the wording in the paragraphs are the only real difference.  As stated in the previous website with this design, it does seem to work.  SouthPark received a 4-star rating from <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/south-park-animal-hospital-charlotte">Yelp.com</a> and a 5-star rating from <a href="http://www.mojopages.com/biz/southpark-animal-hospital-inc/charlotte/nc/28209/6103893?sl=30570887&so=0">Mojopages.com</a>.  According to mojopages, some of their keywords are "surgery", "pet supplies & foods retail", and "boarding".</p>

		<p>According to their reviews on Yelp.com, the competitors seem to have great reviews from people with multiple pets as well as people with older, special needs pets.  It seems that people are spending more time on their websites, and this may be due in part to the fact that St. Francis' website does not offer as much information.  One way to get people to spend more time on our site would be to provide relevant information on each page and lead the user from one page to the next with phrases like "for more information on our vets, visit our staff page".  Some of the keywords that should be used are "animal hospitals", "vaccinations", "specialty pet food", and "emergency services".</p>

		<p>One of the bad practices that is holding our site and Dilworth's site back is a lack of organization on the home page.  Everything looks like it was thrown together instead of thought out.  I would like to place items on the home page into specific locations in order to make the site flow better.  This will make users want to explore further.</p>

	<h2>Targeted Audience:</h2>

		<p>Use Case #1 involves a woman in her late 50s.  She has a small dog that she loves like a child.  She has just retired from working and has moved to the area to live closer to her daughter and grandchildren.  She has just purchased a small home, has one car, and loves to take her dog on long walks in the park nearby. Now she's looking for a vet to care for her dog so she goes online to look for reviews of vets in the area.  She is looking for one that looks inviting, clean, friendly, and knowledgeable.</p>

		<p>Use Case #2 involves a family with two dogs, a cat, and two turtles.  The parents both work full-time, and the two children are involved in sports.  They have a house and two cars.  They don't have a lot of time to sit in a vet's office waiting for their pets to be seen.  They're looking for a vet who can get them in and out quickly.  They need a "one stop shop" where they can have their pet examined, pick up any necessary medication, and buy specialty food if needed.</p>
